		<p>Its as simple as it sounds you try to guess the code that unlocks the safe to the next round and continues from there onwards. There is a numberpad
		which has numbers 1-9 and you use that to input the code to wish to proceed once you are done with the last digit of your guess it will automatically check if the code is correct.
		Then there s the clear button, just like its name its a button used to clear the digits because after all you are a human. </p><hr />
		<h3>Log Sheet:</h3><br />
		<p>The log sheet is the tiny screen on the right side where it displayes the last guess of the user underneath the guess before that and continues 
		from there onwards. In the log sheet in pranthesis next to your guess is the range(how far you are away from the actual code)<br />
		eg: Your Last Guess Was 621(400)</p><hr />
		<h3>The Range:</h3><br />
		<p> The range is the sentence that is written below the key pads that tell you how far your guess was from the actual code</p><hr />
		<h3>Hover Buttons:</h3><br />
		<p> There are two hover buttons on the side that can be used to change the theme of the screen and the other button used to get from that page to here</p><hr />
		<h3>The Slideshow:</h3>
		<p> The slideshow has some sentences to put pressure on the user to guess faster and faster</p>
